## The Remnant of Ash
In the corner of the Vast Plains, far away from Julesvale, there lies an unfortunate mining settlement known only as The Ghost Town. To this day, nearby locals tell a tale of an evil spirit that haunts the town with unfinished business.

Desperado is a Glass Cannon zone-breaker who keeps opponents out with large, disjointed attacks while taking advantage of passive opponents by reloading. While he's light and on the slower side, managing when to fill his chamber with bullets and keeping opponents away with high up-time on Forward Special will be keys to success, allowing him to seal out stocks incredibly early with the use of Neutral Special when he has bullets.

This character was a submission for the Rivals of Aether 2 Workshop Contest.
