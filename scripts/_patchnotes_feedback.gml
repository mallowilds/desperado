Patch Notes and Feedback; Im gonna be using this to document random feedback i get and eventually compile patch notes on here.

-Add hitpause / sound effect to grabbing the skull with uspec/dair?
-Fix ustrong skulless (god lol)

seer:
-Jab 2 has 1 frame less active time than the visual suggests it should. Not a big deal, but its just a bit odd

-Dattack should probably be a few frames slower than it is right now. It first hits on frame 5, which is very... very fast for a Dattack, especially one that has an Ustrong gatling. At the same time tho... that frame 5 hitbox doesn't have great range so... idk man

-Dtilt's range is a decent bit bigger than it suggests it should be. Could probably get away with reignung it in a bit, because it can be a bit silly

-Bulletless Fstrong could probably stand to have its endlag decreased significantly. Right now, it has 31(47) frames of endlag, which is genuinely absurdly high, especially when compared to base /*#cast*/ (Base /*#cast*/ Fstrongs tend to have endlag in the 16(24)-24(36) frame range). I understand the endlag being very high for the bullet version of Fstrong... but the bulletless version? Like... its barely stronger than SK and Ranno Fstrong, it really doesn't warrant being that laggy

-uspecial broken 

-Nair's first hit could probably stand to have a bit more active time. It feels annoyingly stingy to get some times due to the low active time resulting in you missing it by just a hair, so adding a frame more active time would help make it less strict to get

-Bair feels like it could be a bit faster to start up. It currently hits on frame 17, which is incredibly slow for an aerial (for context, outside of air strongs, all but 2 aerials in base /*#cast*/ are faster than that), and it isn't even especially strong to compensate for that slow speed (7 base, 0.6 scaling, angle 140 sourspot, 8 base, 0.75 scaling, angle 140 on the enhanced tipper). You could definitely get away with making it first active on frame 14 or 15, which is the same speed range for slower poking Bairs in base cast
