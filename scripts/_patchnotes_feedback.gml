Changes (1.1, Dec 24):

-Bugfixes/Adjusts: 
    -Fixed seasonal costume appearing on respawn.
    -Removed unnecessary debug text.
	-Added a target visual on NSpecial (HEADSHOT).
	-Added notification for practice mode's reload shortcut.
-Buffs:
    -NSpecial (HEADSHOT) no longer pauses tracking early while the opponent is in hitstun, making it way more reliable.
    -NSpecial (Desperate Measures) final hit KBG has been increased (0.75 to 1.0 -> 0.9 to 1.15).
        -This change makes the move much more effective at late percents for sealing out kills.
        -BKB has been left unchanged (8.25 to 9.5, depending on the number of bullets shot).
	-NSpecial is now limited to one use per airtime (unless refreshed with a DSpecial reload).
		-This is intended to prevent stalling with zero bullets; any usage of NSpecial with bullets should be unaffected.
	-USpecial Throw endlag reduced (17 -> 13)
	-DSpecial max hsp lowered (3 -> 2)
-Nerfs:
    -Opponents hitting the skull now cause Desperado to take 1% self damage.
    -Nspecial (HEADSHOT) now deals 1% self damage per bullet shot.
