Changes (1.1, Dec 26):

-Bugfixes/Adjusts: 
	-Fixed seasonal costume appearing on respawn.
	-Removed unnecessary debug text.
	-Added a target visual on NSpecial (HEADSHOT).
	-Added notification for practice mode's reload shortcut.
	-Adjusted HUD Colors to hopefully be more intuitive across all color palettes, with default adjusted aswell.
	
-Buffs:
	-NSpecial (HEADSHOT) no longer pauses tracking early while the opponent is in hitstun, making it way more reliable.
	-NSpecial (Desperate Measures) final hit KBG has been increased (0.75 to 1.0 -> 0.9 to 1.15).
		-This change makes the move much more effective at late percents for sealing out kills.
		-BKB has been left unchanged (8.25 to 9.5, depending on the number of bullets shot).
	-FStrong startup decreased (24 -> 21)
	-Desperado's Heart size increased (1 -> 3)
	
-Nerfs:
	-Opponents hitting the skull now cause Desperado to take 1% self damage.
	-Nspecial (HEADSHOT) now deals 1% self damage per bullet shot.
	-NSpecial is now limited to one use per airtime (unless refreshed with a DSpecial reload).
		-This is intended to prevent stalling with zero bullets; any usage of NSpecial with bullets should be unaffected.
	-Nair 1 Hitstun Multiplier lowered (.8 -> .7)
	-Nair 1 Startup increased (5 -> 6)
	-Nair 1 KBS Increased (.1 -> .2)
	-Uair landing lag increased (4 -> 5)
	-DSpecial max hsp lowered (3 -> 2)
	-Fspecial damage decreased (3, 4 -> 2, 3)

Changes (1.15, Dec 31)

-Bugfixes/Adjusts:
	-Fixed collision bugs with up b grabbing the skull.
	-Fixed HUD elements breaking when hit out of certain attacks.
	-Changed Forward Special skulls return trajectory when angled up.
		-Small, but should make it a little bit easier to use HEADSHOT.
-Buffs:
	-Increased the size of the final hit of Scorching Forward Tilt, to prevent the move from dropping when above Desperado.
	-Skull no longer gets destroyed when making contact with attacks that deal 0 hitstun. 
		-Technically a bug, but more of a fix.
-Nerfs:
	-Reverted N-Special's KB scaling changes from last patch as they were unnecessary and overboard after initial feedback.
	-Desperado's Heart size decreased (3 -> 1)
		-His christmas tree burned down.

Changes (1.16, Jan 8)

-Happy new year!
-Bugfixes/Adjusts:
	-Fixed sfx playing longer than they should when hit out of certain moves.
	-Jab no longer gives you a bullet if the first hit is parried and you finish the move.
	-If you win the game without a skull, your portrait will be changed to reflect this.

Nerfs:
	-Reduced lerping effect on Fair (40% -> 20%) to make the move look and feel more natural.
	-Reduced hitbox sizes on all 3 hits of jab 
	-Reduced N-Airs hitbox size and brought it closer to the body. It shouldnt be very disjointed at all now.
Buffs:
	-Increased hitbox on Desperate Measures slightly below the gun fire- It was whiffing on some extra tiny characters like Kirby (Spam), but still shouldnt hit most crouches.
	-Corrected one of Back Airs hitboxes being slightly weaker than the others.
	-Back air knockback scaling increased (.6 -> .7). Affects both versions, but tipper stats on Scorched Bair are unchanged.
