Changes (1.1, Dec 24):

-Bugfixes: 
    Fixed seasonal costume appearing on respawn.
    Removed unnecessary debug text.
-Buffs:
    -Nspecial (HEADSHOT) now properly locks if the opponent is in hitstun, becoming way more reliable.
    -Nspecial (Desperate Measures) final hit scaling base increased, 7 -> .85.
        -This change effectively makes the move much more reliable at late percents for sealing out kills.
        -The wording is odd, but it now scales from .9 to 1.15 scaling, whereas before it scaled from .75 to 1.1.
        -For reference, the BKB currently scales from 8.25 to 9.5, depending on the amount of bullets shot.
    
-Nerfs:
    -Opponents hitting the skull now cause Desperado to take 1% self damage.
    -Nspecial (HEADSHOT) now deals 1% self damage per bullet shot.
